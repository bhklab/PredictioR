#' PredictIO Bareche RNA Signature
#'
#' Gene expression signature that demonstrated better and more consistent ability to predict immunotherapy response as compared to other signatures. The specific algorithm is applied to computed the signature score. The PredictIO signature was identified by integrating gene expression data from a large pan-cancer discovery immunotherapy datasets.
